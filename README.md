# SPATIO

3D rendering in Rust, WASM, WebGL (buzzword buzzword buzzword)

This is going to help me introduce readers of my blog articles to the way qubits work (with a bloch sphere) and how lattice based cryptography works (with a low dimensional example of Kyber)

# Build & run
- Clone the repo
- hit'em with the `cargo install`
- maybe need to `cargo install wasm-pack`. not sure, your problem
- `wasm-build target --target web`
- Start an HTTP server in the root directory and open the `index.html`
- Should work
